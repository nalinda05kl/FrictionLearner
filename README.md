Learn the friction of a non-trivial damping pendulum with hinge friction using Neural Networks (insight from Universal Differential Equations (UDE))

Simple pendulam has studied for long period of time and in real world experimants, there are non-conservative friction forces associated with the equation of motion. We use the new approch explained in [1] by using neural networks in the form of Univeral Differential Equations (UDEs) and learn the complicated friction force. We use OPEN CV to extract the data from vidoe of a real pendulum experiment and use as the data for the training process. This project is sill not finished. I will update the most recent results soon.
