Learn the friction of a non-trivial damping pendulum with hinge friction using Neural Networks (insight from Universal Differential Equations (UDE))

Simple pendulum has studied for long period of time and in real world experiments, there are non-conservative friction forces associated with the equation of motion. We use the new approach explained in [1] by using neural networks in the form of Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) to learn the complicated friction force. We use OPEN CV to extract the data from video frames of a real pendulum experiment and use that data for the training process. (Note that this project is still in progress.)
